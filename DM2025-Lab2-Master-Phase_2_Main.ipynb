      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",

      "Of course. The U.S. Computer Science (CS) job market has undergone a significant transformation over the last couple of years. The \"growth-at-all-costs\" frenzy of 2021 has been replaced by a more cautious and competitive environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a breakdown of the key recent trends in the U.S. CS job market.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Takeaway: The \"Great Correction\"\n",
      "The market has shifted from an employee-driven \"seller's market\" to an employer-driven \"buyer's market.\" The hyper-growth fueled by low interest rates and pandemic-era demand has cooled, leading to a market correction. It's not a collapse like the dot-com bust, but it is significantly more challenging, especially for certain segments.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Layoffs and Hiring Slowdowns in Big Tech\n",
      "This is the most visible trend. Major tech companies (like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft) that hired aggressively in 2020-2021 have conducted multiple rounds of large-scale layoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why?** Over-hiring during the pandemic, rising interest rates making capital more expensive, and a push from investors for profitability and \"efficiency.\"\n",
      "*   **Impact:** A large pool of experienced talent is now on the market, increasing competition for all open roles. Hiring at these companies has slowed dramatically, with a much higher bar for new candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. The Rise of AI/ML as the Dominant Growth Area\n",
      "While other areas have slowed, the demand for AI and Machine Learning talent has exploded, largely driven by the advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In-Demand Roles:** AI/ML Engineer, Research Scientist, Prompt Engineer, MLOps Engineer.\n",
      "*   **Required Skills:** Deep knowledge of Python, frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, experience with cloud AI platforms (AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI), and a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics.\n",
      "*   **Impact:** Companies are reallocating budgets and headcount to AI initiatives. If a role has an AI component, it's more likely to be approved and funded.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. The Entry-Level Squeeze\n",
      "New graduates and junior engineers are facing the toughest market in over a decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why it's happening:**\n",
      "    *   **Increased Competition:** They are now competing against laid-off engineers who have 1-3 years of experience.\n",
      "    *   **Reduced Mentorship Capacity:** With leaner teams, companies have less bandwidth to train junior talent.\n",
      "    *   **Risk Aversion:** In a cautious market, companies prefer to hire experienced engineers who can contribute immediately with less risk.\n",
      "*   **Impact:** Internships are more critical than ever. New grads need exceptional portfolios, networking skills, and may need to be more flexible about their first role (e.g., considering QA, IT, or roles at non-tech companies).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. The Return-to-Office (RTO) Push vs. Remote Work\n",
      "The debate over remote work continues to shape the market.\n",
      "\n",

       "Of course. The U.S. Computer Science (CS) job market has undergone a significant transformation over the last couple of years. The \"growth-at-all-costs\" frenzy of 2021 has been replaced by a more cautious and competitive environment.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here’s a breakdown of the key recent trends in the U.S. CS job market.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Takeaway: The \"Great Correction\"\n",
       "The market has shifted from an employee-driven \"seller's market\" to an employer-driven \"buyer's market.\" The hyper-growth fueled by low interest rates and pandemic-era demand has cooled, leading to a market correction. It's not a collapse like the dot-com bust, but it is significantly more challenging, especially for certain segments.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. Layoffs and Hiring Slowdowns in Big Tech\n",
       "This is the most visible trend. Major tech companies (like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft) that hired aggressively in 2020-2021 have conducted multiple rounds of large-scale layoffs.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Why?** Over-hiring during the pandemic, rising interest rates making capital more expensive, and a push from investors for profitability and \"efficiency.\"\n",
       "*   **Impact:** A large pool of experienced talent is now on the market, increasing competition for all open roles. Hiring at these companies has slowed dramatically, with a much higher bar for new candidates.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. The Rise of AI/ML as the Dominant Growth Area\n",
       "While other areas have slowed, the demand for AI and Machine Learning talent has exploded, largely driven by the advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **In-Demand Roles:** AI/ML Engineer, Research Scientist, Prompt Engineer, MLOps Engineer.\n",
       "*   **Required Skills:** Deep knowledge of Python, frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, experience with cloud AI platforms (AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI), and a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics.\n",
       "*   **Impact:** Companies are reallocating budgets and headcount to AI initiatives. If a role has an AI component, it's more likely to be approved and funded.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. The Entry-Level Squeeze\n",
       "New graduates and junior engineers are facing the toughest market in over a decade.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Why it's happening:**\n",
       "    *   **Increased Competition:** They are now competing against laid-off engineers who have 1-3 years of experience.\n",
       "    *   **Reduced Mentorship Capacity:** With leaner teams, companies have less bandwidth to train junior talent.\n",
       "    *   **Risk Aversion:** In a cautious market, companies prefer to hire experienced engineers who can contribute immediately with less risk.\n",
       "*   **Impact:** Internships are more critical than ever. New grads need exceptional portfolios, networking skills, and may need to be more flexible about their first role (e.g., considering QA, IT, or roles at non-tech companies).\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. The Return-to-Office (RTO) Push vs. Remote Work\n",
       "The debate over remote work continues to shape the market.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Big Tech & Finance:** Many large companies are mandating hybrid schedules (typically 3 days in the office), linking office attendance to performance reviews and career progression.\n",

      "\t\t A data center is a dedicated physical facility that an organization uses to house its critical IT infrastructure, including servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and related components. These facilities are designed to provide a secure, reliable, and controlled environment for computing operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Key Components \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Essential components include servers, storage devices, network switches and routers, power supplies (including UPS and generators), cooling systems (HVAC), and physical security measures. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Underlying Technology \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Relationship Between Machine Learning, Data Centers, and LLMs \n",
      "\n",
      "\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development. The techniques used to train LLMs, such as deep learning and neural networks, are core machine learning concepts. Therefore, LLMs are a specific, advanced type of machine learning model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Interdependence \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t In essence, machine learning is the field of study and the set of techniques. LLMs are a powerful manifestation of these techniques. Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

You shouldn\\'t go into this movie expecting \\nintense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur \\nFleck becomes the Joker. \\n \\nI have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I \\nbelieve it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand \\nArthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or \\nbad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away \\none of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie. \\n \\nJoaquin Phoenix\\'s performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie \\npossibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by \\nsociety and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn\\'t acting, he \\nis evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn\\'t put on an Oscar \\nwinning performance, they\\'re out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to \\nstart, but it has to be. We couldn\\'t just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We \\nneed to know where it came from to begin with. \\n \\nThe whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving \\nperformance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. \\nEverything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy \\nsurrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those \\nwho can\\'t appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this \\nmovie. \\n \\nI have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and \\nDC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out \\nare trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it \\ntakes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the \\nevolution to appreciate this movie. It\\'s not an action movie, but it\\'s really rips and \\ntears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No \\nother comic book movie has done that before.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "**Note:** You might see an `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` error when running the following code all at once, this is because the `current API Rate Limit handling cannot reliably find out how many requests we have left per minute` from cell to cell, there is no Gemini feature created for it to get the information from their servers. So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
