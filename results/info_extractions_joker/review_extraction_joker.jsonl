seemed like there was potential for an \naction packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended \nto be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting \nintense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur \nFleck becomes the Joker. \n \nI have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I \nbelieve it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand \nArthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or \nbad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away \none of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie. \n \nJoaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie \npossibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by \nsociety and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he \nis evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar \nwinning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to \nstart, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We \nneed to know where it came from to begin with. \n \nThe whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving \nperformance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. \nEverything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy \nsurrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those \nwho can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this \nmovie. \n \nI have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and \nDC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out \nare trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it \ntakes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the \nevolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and \ntears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No \nother comic book movie has done that before.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_d34b0ce3"}
